# sveeeth

A [viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem) wrapper built for Svelte that provides helpful store and utility functions.

Reactive stores to access useful connected wallet data.

```js
import { connect, disconnect, account, network, contract } from "sveeeth";
import { Metamask, Walletconnect, ... } from "sveeeth/connectors";
import { mainnet, goerli, ... } from "sveeeth/chains";
```

# ðŸš— Roadmap

- [x] **connect:** Connect to wallet
- [x] **disconnect:** Disconnect from wallet
- [ ] **switchNetwork:** Switch network
- [x] **account:** The connected account details
- [x] **network:** The connected network details
- [x] **contract:** Create a contract instance
- [x] **chains:** re-exports everything from wagmi/core
- [x] **connectors:** re-exports everything from wagmi/core
